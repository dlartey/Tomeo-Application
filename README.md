# Tomeo-Application
A Group Project coded in C++ for playing videos

This was built using QTCreator and QTDesigner in C++. The goal of this project was to create an application for a client based on their requirements, where we had to design low-fidelity prototypes, graudally improving them to high-fidelity prototypes until the client was satisfied with them.

As part of this process, a video player was made which is functional and also a requirements specification and design specificaion were made.

To run this project yourself, please download [Qt Creator] (https://www.qt.io/product/development-tools). Then you will be prompted to download [MinGW] (https://www.mingw-w64.org/), which is a GNU compiler for windows.

Then once you have downloaded this, then you can open QT Creator and navigate to
```
code/the.pro
```
and open this in Qt Creator

Then set. build directory to be no later than [Qt 5.13.2](https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-5.13.2-released)

Then navigate to projects/run and specify the location where the videos are

Now you should be able to run the application
